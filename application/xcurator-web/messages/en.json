    "WhatIsAI": {
        "title": "What does artificial intelligence mean?",
        "text": "<li>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science. It involves getting computers to act in certain ways that humans perceive as intelligent. <ideaLink>The idea is over 100 years old</ideaLink> and today's technology can be used in various applications. You can find artificial intelligence in your smartphone or in your music recommendations. What has been new in recent years is the development of generative technologies that enable images or texts to be created automatically. This is why it is often said that artificial intelligence can also be 'creative'. You can find many exciting <learningLink>learning resources here</learningLink>.</li><li>Artificial intelligence refers to various technologies, such as artificial neural networks for image recognition or language models for translating or creating texts. </li><li>Incidentally, we prefer to talk about machine intelligence and have already discussed this a lot. <readMore>You can read about it here</readMore>. </li><li>In xCurator, machine intelligence is used to make the digital collections more accessible, personalised and interest-driven, and to help you make connections and create your own stories. </li><li>This sometimes works quite well and is helpful, but sometimes we perceive machine-generated results as 'wrong' because many calculations are probabilities or approximate values and a 100% accuracy rate can only be achieved with human help. We must therefore learn to deal with these approximate values, to critically assess machine-generated results or to process them correctly ourselves. This is sometimes not so easy to bear. </li><li>Perhaps you like collecting errors or helping us to improve the algorithms? You can use the feedback functions to help assess and train machine-generated results and improve the processes.</li><li>Please note that machine intelligence is not human intelligence - your own judgement is always most important. </li>"

    "WhyAI": {
        "title": "Why do we use Artificial Intelligence?",
        "text": "<li>Artificial intelligence should be used ethically and for the common good and support human authorship and responsible behaviour. With xCurator, we worked with the public and experts to find ways to make the digital museum more accessible. </li><li>Machine learning and deep learning can be used to take a fresh look at what already exists. The ability of artificial neural network processes to reorganise archives or exhibits in collections can make new connections visible. </li><li>In the Creative User Empowerment project, various methods were investigated and developed to create new access to digital collections using machine intelligence. The focus was always on the question of how the processes can best support users and what role and image we want to attribute to artificial intelligence. We know from the history of ideas that ideas about abstract concepts change over time. Our understanding of artificial intelligence must therefore always be understood historically. <dataLabLink>To the project documentation and experimental space</dataLabLink>. </li>"

        "text": "<li>Wherever you see this symbol<imageLiSmall></imageLiSmall>, we use machine learning or show results with the help of generative artificial intelligence:</li><li>Intelligent search: How creatively can you search? The system suggests objects that match your specified interests and searches. On the homepage, museum objects are sorted into so-called clusters, which help you to access the variety of objects in the collection more quickly and coherently. The intelligent search includes a visual search based on similarities and pattern recognition and algorithms pre-sort the variety of content for you. Just give it a try! </li><li>You can use intelligent filter options to expand or narrow down the search by colour, time, material and location.</li><li>Machine-generated keywords and intelligent enrichment: New keywords were generated from the image and text information to help create new connections between things. Help the museum by assessing the quality of the keywords and automatic links. </li><li>Similarity search and recommendations: The images of the objects have been analysed and made accessible via an image search, which means that colours, motifs, objects and themes in images are recognised. Images are sorted into groups by the system so that you are shown content and visual connections. When you create a new story, you will receive recommendations based on your search and title details as to which objects might be suitable. </li><li>Personalised settings allow you to find more exciting things more quickly and discover your individual approach to the past. Your personal data is safe with us and is not processed by artificial intelligence processes. </li><li>Generative texts: The tool helps you to create texts and recognise connections between things. You can use xCurator as a co-pilot to develop new, creative and exciting contexts. We have worked a lot on the data basis so that the language model doesn't hallucinate so much, but instead draws on the collection data and really new and exciting content. However, you can give the language model hints as to what it should do for you. But be careful, you have to judge the results of the language model yourself! Simply use the museum texts to help you. </li><li>For security reasons, we have preset the prompts. If you have any good suggestions on how the prompts can be improved or if you would like a specific prompt for your story, the museum would be happy to hear from you!</li>"

Why? Because language models characterise our present day and offer opportunities as well as risks. Because it is important to actively engage with the effects of forms of artificial intelligence such as language models - including in protected spaces and through culture. Here you can practise creating content with the help of language models on a solid factual basis.
